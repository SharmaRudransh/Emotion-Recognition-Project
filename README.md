Usage
Running the Emotion Recognition Model
To run the emotion recognition model, simply execute the following command:

python emotion_recognition.py
    Input
You can provide input either via:

Text: Type a sentence or paragraph to analyze emotions.
Speech: Upload an audio file, and the software will transcribe and analyze the speech.
Face Image: Upload an image containing a human face, and the software will detect emotions from facial expressions.
Example:
python emotion_recognition.py --input "I am so happy today!"
     Arguments:
--input: The text, audio file, or image file you want to analyze.
--mode: The input type (text, audio, image). Default is text.
